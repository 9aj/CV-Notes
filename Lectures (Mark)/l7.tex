\section{Applications and Deep Learning}
This section is not really covered in the exam. To be added to:

\subsection{Features at Different Levels}
We can show the features by different levels for use in a deep learning model.

\subsection{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item Computer vision works and has a great future
    \item Big difference between hand crafted and deep learning
    \item Some parts are the same, e.g. group operators/template
